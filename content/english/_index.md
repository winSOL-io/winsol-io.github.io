  heading: "Swap average rewards for a chance at the entire pot"
  description: "<p>If low staking rewards don't get your dopamine receptors buzzing, we have just the trick for you.</p>

	<h4>winSOL runs a unique staking pool.</h4> 
<p>Instead of sharing the rewards earned by the pool each epoch between each staker, we do things differently.</p>
<p>We sweep all the rewards into a prize fund, cover our costs then give the rest away in a huge free prize draw.
</p><p>
There's nothing to lose - your staked funds are safe and secured by Solana's audited stake pool program.  You can withdraw whenever you like. </p>
<p>But by forgoing the standard staking rewards of 5-6%, you're in with a chance to win a great deal more.<p>"

  title: "How to play"
  heading: "How does this all work?"
  description: "	
<p>Simple! All you need to do to be in with a chance to win is stake with our staking pool.</p>
<p>Your money is securely held by Solana's Staking program and delegated to Solana validators on your behalf, securing and decentralizing the Solana network. In turn, we collect all the staking rewards due to the pool.</p>

	<p>For every SOL you stake, you receive one winSOL. This is effectively your entrance ticket. Each winSOL - or fraction of winSOL, no matter how small - stands a chance to win from the rewards pool.</p
	
	<p>Every 7 days we tot up the proceeds from the staking pool, less costs. Then we use our random number generator, bERNIE, to pick 110 lucky winners.</p>
	
	<p>Each SOL - nay, every lamport you stake - stands a chance to win. Whether you stake 0.003 SOL or 3.2k SOL you're in with a chance, but the more you stake, the better your chances.</p>
