#### What is winSOL

winSOL is a new stake pool, run on the same program as Marinade, Socean and JPool.

But winSOL is a bit different.


Just like the others, winSOL stakes your SOL with Solana validators, and in exchange gives you a staking token, winSOL. 


But unlike the other pools, no rewards are shared with holders.


Instead, each week every winSOL holder is entered into a draw. 110 lucky winners will be picked at random to receive the week's staking rewards.

This means:
- All SOL staked will be kept secure by the audited, open source Solana Labs Stake Pool program
- Each staker has a chance to win rewards far above the average 6%
- Some stakers will receive 0%
- 1 winSOL will always be worth 1 SOL, forever

#### Why stake with winSOL?

Because not everybody gets excited about 6% a year.

Staking your SOL is a fantastic way to support, secure and decentralize the Solana network. Not to mention the fact that you earn new SOL every epoch, at an average rate of 6% per year.

But for many, traditional staking is a trifle dull. There's a reason NFTs, trading, defi and coin flip games get a lot more attention: the chance of increasing your portfolio at an outsized rate. Trouble is, all these other platforms increase your risk and you could easily end up with less SOL than you started with.

winSOL gives you an alternative: 
- Every SOL staked is the equivalent of 1 billion entries into our prize draw. 
- Every week 110 of these entries could win a share of the rewards the pool has generated in the last 7 days

With traditional staking, 1 SOL staked will earn you just 0.06 SOL by the end of the year.

But with winSOL your 1 SOL could win you 12 SOL ... or instead you may earn 0 SOL for the year. That's your risk. You will always be able to withdraw your 1 SOL, and will never lose it. But you are risking the future earnings of 0.06 SOL for the chance at a much bigger prize.
