#### What are the risks of staking with winSOL?

winSOL is a no-loss staking protocol. This means that you are staking, not gambling your SOL and should always be able to withdraw as much SOL as you put into the pool. Your principal remains yours to withdraw at any time.

As with any smart contract on Solana, interacting with our app does add protocol risk to your portfolio: namely, should a vulnerability be found in the Solana Labs Stake Pool Program, your funds may be at risk. That said, we have chosen to build on the Stake Pool Program without modification so you have the confidence in a program that is
* open source
* written by Solana Labs
* has passed multiple audits
* is used in production by a number of large stake pools with millions of SOL in TVL

Our winner selection and prize distribution script has not yet been audited.
