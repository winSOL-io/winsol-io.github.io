### Protocol Fees

winSOL will take a 15% fee on stake rewards earned before prize distribution. This may be revised via governance votes in months to come. At no time do you pay any fees on your initial stake.


### Stake Pool Program Fee Parameters

* Epoch (Rewards) Fee: 100%
* Deposit Fee: 0%
* Withdrawal Fee: 0%

In order to retain the staking rewards in the prize pool rather than distributing them to stakers, it is necessary to run our stake pool at 100% commission on rewards.

This is because for most pools the rewards are deposited into the main pool staking accounts. This is controlled by the stake pool program to ensure pool operators have no way of stealing funds from the pool. This is what protects your deposits, however it makes it hard for us to give away the rewards instead of sharing them equally.

By taking a 100% commission, we move all staking rewards into an account controlled by winSOL, while keeping your principal - the staked SOL - secure in an audited, open source contract.

Once it is there, we can take a small fee and distribute prizes.
