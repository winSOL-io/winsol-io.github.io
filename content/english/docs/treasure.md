The Vault Hunter collection is a team of expert adventurers, treasure hunters, pirates and villans who will help maximize your yield.

By sending your Vault Hunter on a quest it adds a modifier to your entries to the winSOL pool, increasing your chances of winning.

This modifier compounds - so each additional hunter you stake increases your chances by a percentage

Rare, high level Vault Hunters have a higher modifier than common, so make sure you build a team of the very best hunters you can find!

##### Vault Hunter Skill Levels

| Skill Level | Modifier |
| ---------- | --------|
| Level 1 | +0.7% |
| Level 2 | +0.9% |
| Level 3 | +1.2% |

##### Example calculations

**Jimmy NoNFTs** deposits 10 SOL in the pool. Each week Jimmy gets 10,000,000,000 (10 billion) entries into the draw

**Sally Solo** holds a single Level 3 rare NFT, and deposits 10 SOL in the pool. Sally gets a 1.2% boost to her entries, so she receives 

```
10,000,000,000 * 1.012 = 10,120,000,000 
```

10,120,000,000 (10 billion, 120 million) entries to the draw

**Willy Whale** holds 5 level 1, 4 Level 2 NFTs and 2 Level 3. He deposits 5 SOL in the pool, and receives:

```
5,000,000,000 * 
1.007 * 1.007 * 1.007 * 1.007 * 1.007 * 
1.009 * 1.009 * 1.009 * 1.009 * 
1.012 * 1.012
=
5,495,953,470 entries 
```

As you can see, building a party of skilled adventurers can hugely increase your chances of winning the weekly winSOL draw!

##### How to send a vault hunter on a quest

While the hunter is in your wallet or listed on a marketplace such as MagicEden they cannot help you search for treasure.

In order for you to benefit from the skills your hunters bring to your party, you must stake it on our site.

Staking will be launched within hours of the public mint.
