faq:
- title: "Who's bERNIE?"
  content: "Glad you asked. bERNIE is our random number generator that picks the winner each week. You can check the code on github [link] but here's the gist:
	
    <ol><li>Bernie checks the amount of SOL in the reward account</li>
  <li>He calculates each prize amount</li>
  <li>Then he takes the entire list of winSOL holders - naughty or nice - weighted by the amount of winSOL  they hold</li>
  <li>He then tosses the biggest dice you've ever seen to find which winSOL holder wins the prize</li>
<li>Once that prize is transferred, he repeats for each smaller prize</li></ol>
"
- title: "How can I verify prize payouts?"
  content: "Unlike most old gits, bErnie adores github, and will publish a report to his repo every time he sends out prizes. All transfers will be verifiable on chain."
- title: "Is this Safe?"
  content: "<p>Yes ser. At all times your SOL is held in an account managed by Solana Lab's Stake Pool Program, and is untouchable by our devs. At any time you can unstake or exchange your winSOL and receive your SOL back. You'll never get out less SOL than you put in.</p>
	
	<p>Due to the way the Solana stake pool program works, you may need to wait until the end of the epoch to receive all your SOL. We plan to setup a liquidity pool in the near future that will allow an 'instant unstake' for a small fee, just as you can at Marinade and other stake pools.</p>
"
- title: "Is this some kind of degen  casino?"
  content: "<p>Hell no. It is a fun game of chance, but you'll never make a loss in SOL terms. You can withdraw your SOL at any time.</p>
  <p>The only cost is opportunity cost - you could stake elsewhere for a guaranteed return, or stake here for the chance at an outsized one. You're not betting or risking anything, simply opting to give up your vanilla staking rewards to the pool for the chance of winning the pot.</p>
	
<p>Chances are - your governement may even offer the same thing! </p>
<p>In the UK they call it Premium Bonds, NZ offers 'Bonus Bonds', Ireland 'Prize Bonds' and in Scandinavia it's a 'Premieobligationer'. Only when the government do it the prizes come from a mind achingly dull fiat interest rate of 1%. On Solana staking rewards are 6x that, so your potential rewards are worth a lot more too.</p>"
- title: "So do I pay taxes on this?"
  content: "<p>We are not financial advisors! But in many countries, similar products  - or indeed winnings from lotteries or free prize draws - are treated as gifts or windfalls and are thus exempt from tax.</p><p>It's possible that in your jurisdiction winnings from winSOL are indeed tax free. But you really should ask your accountant, not some anons on the internet.</p>"
