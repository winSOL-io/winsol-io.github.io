  title: "Utility"
  heading: "Vault Hunters Help You Win More SOL"
  description: "<p>The Vault Hunters represent your chance to bootstrap the liquidity of winSOL, an exciting new no-loss lottery platform. Similar to Premium Bonds, the winSOL pools revenue from staking Solana, running a free prize draw each week where every staker stands a chance of winning the pool's rewards.</p>

<p><em>Every fraction of a SOL deposited in the pool is effectively a lottery ticket with a chance to win,</em> granting entries every week for as long as it remains staked. And at any time, win or lose, you can unstake your initial investment. 1 winSOL = 1 SOL.</p>

<p><strong>So what of the Vault Hunters?</strong> True to their namesake, your heroes will actively quest for you, seeking out more treasure and higher winnings from the pool. For every hero you hold you will receive a greater chance of fwinning. Depending on rarity, each hero increases your chance by an extra 1-3%.</p>

<p>This modifier compounds, so the more heroes you hold, the more chance you have to win."

  title: "Post Mint"
  heading: "How will the mint proceeds be used?"
  description: "
<p>The majority of mint proceeds (60%) will be used to bootstrap liquidity in the winSOL pool. This initial stake will be deposited into the pool, and will be excluded from the prize draw until the pool reaches 100,000 SOL in TVL. The winSOL tokens received by the mint wallet will then be locked in a StreamFlow vesting contract, with 25% unlocking after 6 months and the remainder releasing weekly for the following 6 months. </p> 

<p>This means from the day the pool launches stakers stand to win a minimum of 10.5 SOL each week - a figure that can only rise as the total stake delegated to the pool increases. For example, should we reach the size of Marinade we'd be looking at a weekly giveaway of 312 SOL - every week.</p>

<p>The rest of the mint will be spent as follows:
<ul>
<li>15% to start LPs such as winSOL/SOL and winSOL/USDC</li>
<li>15% to development</li>
<li>10% for ongoing marketing</li>
</ul></p>
